# VBA-challenge
Week 2 homework in VBA

## Expected Behavior

For this homework, we are going to run a vba code on the "alphabetical_tesing.xlsm" file. Once we've mastered the module, we will use the code on the "multiple_year_stock_data.xlxm" file.

## Solution

I've upload the vba file which for some reason came out as a .bas file. If there's an error with that, look at vbascript.txt fiel which has the same vba code used to execute code for the homework.
